A sample proejct to record, update any status of workflow of a carwash event

## Description

This is based on my personal experience of working at a carwash where everyday during the summer there are more than 10 cars a day and each cars need to take approximately 2 hrs to complete. We have 2 working slots, one for exterior carwash and one for interior detailing.
